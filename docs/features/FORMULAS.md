# Core Formulas and Definitions

## The "Definitional" Formula

**Formula:** e ≡ AΦ

**Symbol:** The triple bar (≡), meaning "is defined as" or "is identical to."

**Catchy Reading:** "Emotion is, by definition, the interaction of Awareness and the Field."

**Deeper Meaning:** This is stronger than e = AΦ. Equality implies two different things can have the same value. Identity (≡) states that they are fundamentally the same thing. It's a bold, philosophical declaration that this isn't just a calculation; it's the very definition of what emotion is.

**Vibe:** Bold, foundational, philosophical, and assertive.
